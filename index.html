                <p>We're currently looking for the next best bartender in Belfast.. Do you think you have what it takes?
                    <br> We want someone who knows what they're doing, can recognise if someones a little too young to be served, someone 
                    who is quick-thinking and knows how to serve all the customers that will come through. If you think you can step up, apply and we'll 
                    get you in for a trial shift at one of our locations.
